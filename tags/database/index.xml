Caching is widely used in various systems, including web applications, databases, operating systems, and more.
Why Use Caching? The main purpose of caching is to reduce the response time of the system. When a user requests data from the system, the system retrieves the data from the primary storage, which can be slow in some cases.</description></item></channel></rss>
