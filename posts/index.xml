Caching is widely used in various systems, including web applications, databases, operating systems, and more.
Why Use Caching? The main purpose of caching is to reduce the response time of the system. When a user requests data from the system, the system retrieves the data from the primary storage, which can be slow in some cases.</description></item><item><title>What is a load balancer?</title><link>https://yazeed1s.github.io/blog/posts/load-blanacer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yazeed1s.github.io/blog/posts/load-blanacer/</guid><description>what is a load balancer? A load balancer is a component that acts as a reverse proxy and evenly distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers ensuring that no single server bears all the workload(see figure 1). The workload distribution between servers undoubtedly enhances the reliability, responsiveness, flexibility and availability of the system.

For additional scalability and redundancy, we can try to load balance at each layer of our system:</description></item></channel></rss>
